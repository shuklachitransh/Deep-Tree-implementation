# Full-Stack Tree Structure Application

## Objective
Create a full-stack application using Next.js for the front end and NestJS for the backend to build, manage, and persist a tree structure with a depth of 10,000 nodes.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Initial Setup
**Project Setup:**
- Frontend: Set up a new Next.js project. 🌐
- Backend: Set up a new NestJS project. 🔧
- Version Control: Initialize a Git repository for version control. 🗃️

### Milestone 2: Basic Frontend Structure
**Project Structure:**
- Follow best practices for code structure and modularization in the Next.js project.
- Create basic components (e.g., TreeNode, Tree).

**User Authentication:**
- Implement a simple username input form.
- Set up state management (e.g., React context or Redux) for managing user state.

### Milestone 3: Backend Structure and User Management
**Backend Setup:**
- Set up the basic structure for the NestJS project.

**Database Integration:**
- Integrate a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL). 🗄️
- Design and implement a schema for storing user information and tree structures. 📝

**API Endpoints for User Management:**
- Create an endpoint to validate and register unique usernames. 🔐
- Implement robust input validation and error handling for these endpoints.

### Milestone 4: Tree Data Structure and State Management
**Tree Data Structure:**
- Implement a data structure to represent a tree with a depth of 10,000 nodes in the front end. 🌳
- Initialize each node with the value 1.

**State Management:**
- Use appropriate state management to manage the tree's state efficiently.

### Milestone 5: Basic Tree UI and Node Interaction
**Tree UI Components:**
- Create React components to represent tree nodes. 🖼️
- Design a UI that can handle a tree with significant depth, considering performance and usability. ⚙️

**Node Interaction:**
- Implement functionality to handle clicks on leaf nodes.
- Ensure that when a leaf node is clicked, we can edit its value, and its value is updated and propagated up to all its parent nodes.

### Milestone 6: API Endpoints for Tree Management
**API Endpoints for Tree Operations:**
- Implement an endpoint to save the entire tree structure for a given username.
- Create an endpoint to retrieve a saved tree structure for a username.
- Ensure robust input validation and error handling for these endpoints.

### Milestone 7: Frontend-Backend Integration
**API Communication:**
- Set up secure communication between the Next.js frontend and the NestJS backend.
- Implement proper error handling for network requests. 🚦

**Save Functionality:**
- Add a "Save" button to the front end.
- Implement logic to ensure all updates are complete before saving.
- Send the entire tree structure to the backend when the "Save" button is clicked.

### Milestone 8: Performance Optimization
**Optimization Techniques:**
- Optimize both frontend and backend to handle large tree structures efficiently. ⚡
- Implement lazy loading or virtualization techniques if necessary. 💤
